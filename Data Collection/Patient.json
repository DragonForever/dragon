You can suddenly develop reactions to foods that you were fine with in the past.  Still try a food diary to see if what you are eating at present is the cause.  For example,  I didn't have an intolerance to certain fatty foods when I was a child, but when I reached my late teens, I developed problems digesting certain fatty foods.   I still have this problem but not as bad as before.  Avoidance of these trigger foods stops my bad reactions. Try eliminating bread and other foods containing gluten.  You may have trouble with gluten which can manifest as non celiac gluten intolerance where you can eat a little gluten, or celiac disease which means you can't eat any gluten.  Symptoms of celiac can include   and  .  Ask for celiac blood test and or an endoscopy to identify it.  However, for these tests,  you need to be eating gluten containing foods for the test to be accurate.  Bread might be the culprit."

While taking this course, I felt somewhat better. But by day 4, I was very dehydrated and went to a local hospital.\nThey then gave me stat doses of IV DNS+MVL, Drotin IV, Emeset 4mg IV, and Pantop 40 IV. Following this, I was prescribed with 5 days of T. Ciplox TZ, T. Mehrogyl 200, C. Imodium, C Dorolac, and Oral Rehydration Salts.\nDuring this second round of meds, I felt somewhat better. However I'm still vomitting after eating/drinking more than tiny bits. I am also feeling stomach cramping  and having yellow diarrhea.\nI've talked to my doctor and the hospital staff and they are convinced that I am just having upset stomach due to the local food or water. I believe those are not the causes- i only drink purified bottled water (which I've drank for two years with no problem) and since being sick, I've only eaten plain, simple food like rice or toast without spices.\nWhat could be the cause of this?\nI traveled to Mumbai days before getting sick and live in Delhi, India. Since getting sick, I've only eaten simple foods like plain rice and bread. Water has all been double filtered. That means that the infection first happened 2 weeks ago in Mumbai and two rounds of antibiotics haven't gotten rid of this problem.",

Vanessalee, i know you can't pinpoint food as the cause, but have you kept a food diary to see if there are any food triggers. Also, the cause may be pancreatic as the pancreas cannot always be seen on a scan as it sits behind the stomach. Try the food diary.  If his diet consists of spicey or fried foods or anything that can irritate the gut such as fizzy drinks and citrus fruits leave them out of the diet and just use bland recipes like chicken, fish veggies but a little of sprouts, cabbage, broc as too much can cause gas. Plenty of water.

IBS can be felt on the left side because that's where the intestines are located. \u00a0Frequent   or   or a mixture of both is also a sign of IBS. Stress can cause IBS and makes existing IBS worse. I have stress related IBS and started off with constant, daily, generalised stomach pain that moved about and caused four different types of pain: dull, deep seated, stabbing and sore to touch. \u00a0I had constipation and back pain which changed to loose, urgent stools. \u00a0This went on for three and a half months. I had an ultrasound, stool tests, a urine test, and a celiac test which showed nothing. \u00a0On my eighth visit to my doctor, I was diagnosed with IBS. My health anxiety disappeared and my IBS much improved. When all your tests are negative, IBS can be diagnosed. \u00a0IBS s functional and doesn't show on any scan. \u00a0 You could ask for a SECHAT scan to check for Bile acid malabsorption which causes diarrhoea. \u00a0Sometimes this condition is misdisgnosed as IBS D. \u00a0However, I would try monitoring your diet, \u00a0controlling stress levels and an antispasmodic first. \u00a0You may have to try several. If these things help, it is likely to be IBS. \u00a0However, sometimes IBS does not respond to any treatment. In short, his symptoms sound very like IBS."

We are basically at the same spot as you, doctor doesn't really have anything else to do just prescribing meds for IBS now that haven't worked so far. To me it really sounds like something related to the pancreas however his MRI showed it was good.

Tell me does this sound like IBS to you?\nHe has a near constant pain on his left side below his ribs. Sometimes when it's at its worst it radiates into his back. It is often worst when he first wakes up in the morning and eating usually makes to feel better. He describes the feeling sometime as being similar to feeling exremely hungry or like knots in his stomach (like being anxious) even when there is nothing anxious on his mind. It is worse when he is tired or stressed but can be sitting down having a a great relaxing time thinking of nothing to do with this pain and it starts up. Ultrasounds were clear.  He's had endoscopy, colonsocopy,  MRI and bloods were all good. He does have diahreoah often. There Is no difference with foods that we can find. We are desperate and grasping at straws so any ideas are very welcome.  Also he has been off work for 10 weeks because of this because his job is strssful and it is not better. Thanks everyone. ",

So instead of being able to concentrate on the idea I would be listening for something else. I had to figure out what relaxed me before I could get my mind off my problems and if you think about it thats what it takes. They do have regular kind that just play a sound like an old steam train, or crickets. Try a few and see which makes you feel relaxed or which makes you feel more tense. then you can use them to filter out outside sounds and noise any time you need it. I am a country girl living in the city and all the noise gets me riled up so if I play a recording of rain I relax. A lot of stress we don't even realize its building up but our body knows & signals us to take action somehow. If we don't listen, like a car without maintenance it will  break down sooner or later. a car will completely seize up and you can't drive it no matter how much you want to. You could push it or pull it but its not using its own power because it can't. Hope this helps, I just know what happened to me & how I had to do something or end up worse."

    "post": "I have a bad habit - started about 4 months ago - of burping up food I've eaten. Google calls this \"regurgitation.\" I remember the moment it first started - I was doing a push-up at the gym and I almost damaged the workout pad I was using when a little bit came out of my mouth. So that tells me that what was coming up was fairly acidic.\nFast forward to tonight - after eating too much oily beef broth for lunch, I'm finding myself nauseous, and burping up food to try to relieve the sensation. And I'm noticing something odd. What's coming up out of my stomach is not just beef broth, but also the walnuts I had for breakfast, and everything tastes exactly the same as it did when it went down. It's neither sour nor bitter, but salty and oily, with bits of walnut.\nThis tells me that the walnuts I ate 12 hours ago are still in my stomach, completely undigested.\nI'm like a bird momma, except I don't have anyone to feed except myself.\nDoes anyone have any light to shed on this? What's going on with my stomach? Should I see a professional?\nAside from all the burping, which is quite gross to anyone but me I'm sure, the only \"symptoms\" I could name are the re-appearance of eczema on both my hands and extremely dry skin. Some would interpret that as a deficiency of some sort. Otherwise, my sleep is good, appetite is present, can't complain about bowel movements.",

    "post": "Hi there. I\u2019m a 24 year old female who has been plagued by health issues for the last several years. It\u2019s taken such a tole on my life and happiness, and no dr or specialist can seem to make heads or tales of what\u2019s happening to my body so I\u2019ve turned to the internet to see if anyone out there has any ideas or suggestions.\nIt all started in 2015 when I went to a music festival in Chicago and came down with bronchitis that I couldn\u2019t get over for 5 months. I was prescribed prednisone, albuterol inhaler treatments and Bactrim. After taking the Bactrim I started having severe stomach burning pain, high \n, \n and extreme nausea. I discontinued use and couldn\u2019t get rid of the nausea. I weighed 123 and I\u2019m 5\u20195\u2019 and I lost 15 lbs due to the nausea being so bad. I could have a few crackers a day and that was it. Over the next few months my stomach got a minuscule amount better but I was still plagued with constant nausea. I had my gallbladder checked and tried eliminating certain foods to see if they were a trigger but nothing seemed to help. This constant nausea continued until 2017 and was bad enough that it made it hard to keep a job. I felt miserable all the time. I only ever seemed to feel better when I would get super hungry, but the nausea would return full force once I ate. In 2017 I had a horrible week of nausea, then all the sudden I came down with a fever of 104\u00b0, agonizing body and joint aches, numb lips and hands and a splitting \n. This continued through the night. I took 2 Tylenol pm and woke up the next morning feeling so much better. After this incident my stomach seemed to have improved a lot! I could eat more consistently and the nausea, though still present, was lessened. I would still have some good days and some worse days, which always seemed random. If I woke up nauseous, I was nauseous the whole day. Flash forward to 2019. New Year\u2019s Eve I suddenly had a fainting spell where I got incredibly nauseous, sweaty, couldn\u2019t hear or see and it took a long time for my senses to come back. Once they did, I couldn\u2019t stop shivering. These fainting/dizzy spells have now continued nearly every day and most often occur in the mornings. I\u2019m struggling again with more consistent nausea and that on top of the fainting has me grasping at any strings I can find. I recently had an upper endoscopy which came back mostly normal aside from some light acid damage.\nIf you have any insight into what this could be or anything that could help, please please tell me!!!",

I've had several endoscpies along the way and diagnosed with Barrett's Esophagus, or better known as GERD or acid reflux. Barretts can be serious as the acids from the stomach can eventually cause esophogeal  . Therefore, it's important to keep the gas to the lowest possible level.\u00a0 Anyway, to answer your question, the only medication that helped me substantially was a med called PANTRAPAZOLE -40 MGS.. Now, no two people are alike and what may work for me, may not work for you, etc, but that's my story. One pill in the morning and there's no belching or gas for 24 hours. Of course a sensible diet helps too, staying away from the fatty foods and spicy sauces, etc.\u00a0 I hope you find relief in your burping. I know how annoying it can be. Mine would coe and go and when it was in rare form, it was a nightmare. Take care, Glenn"

I noticed that after I force myself to burp, more aire immediately moves into place. My problem was caused from mold exposure. After a year or so of multiple exposures, I started belching. When it is bad, I belch up to 3 hours constantly. When it isn't bad, I belch throughout the day but not as much. It's still uncomfortable. Because I was exposed to mold, my lung movement became impaired. This felt like if I had taken a deep breath and held it in and could not relax my lungs to push the air out. In other words, my lungs were stuck in an over inflated /expanded position all of the time. When I have air in my stomach (bloated), I can feel the air pushing upward on my diaphragm preventing the diaphragm from downward movement when breathing in. The bloating pushes up on my diaphragm and my lungs have less room to expand. A   confirmed that my lungs were over expanded. My lungs are a little better now, but not fully recovered as is evidenced by my impaired lung movement when I am bloated. After I intentionally burp, I can breathe easier. \u00a0I find that when I lied down I breath the easiest. I believe this is because the air is pushing against the inside of my abdomen, not diaphragm.\u00a0"

I ask because I had a lot of those kind of things and it was not until I got thyroid tests that they saw I had bad results. I also had problems with my pituitary function. I thought I had so many different problems and no answers and researched each little thing trying to figure it out. They can test your thyroid levels and go from there. It might take more than 1 test to compare at different times but its worth asking just to set your own mind at ease. A head injury can set off pituitary problems in women."

I was told its for the last 20 years , then my bowel perforated resulting in emergency surgery , they thought it was appendix but upon looking through a camera they see it was much more than that.  So i had a right hemicolectomy  to remove the infected bowel.  Previously though twice i had a   and   and they said all appeared normal in the bowel but they could not reach all the way round due to scar tissue? But assumed it looked normal.  They were very wrong.  So diverticulitis got infected and it perforated my bowel.  20 years treated for ibs ,, i also get amemic often and need high protein and high fibre and high water intake to help my body get goodness as my Cecum was infected for so long causing bloating nausea extreme pain after food,  felt like i couldn't eat or drink as not long after i would be crippled with pain.    i suffer with too but I have high  ,  ocds too so secret worrying causes this i think. Please ask them to check for other bowel diseases.  I was clear on all tests so there must be better ones out there as all omg it was not clear."

            "reply_content": "IBS is different for everyone so it is possible to get localised pain from IBS.   Your doctor is right about this.   Some people get shifting pain, come and go pain or it can be generalised or constant.  No one person is the same.    When you have an ultrasound, all abdominal organs are scanned, including your gallbladder.  If gallbladder problems were found, you would have been told.    However, if you are still stressing about your gallbladder, ask for a HIDA scan to check gallbladder function. On the other hand, since all your tests have been negative, I would accept your doctor's diagnosis of IBS.   Your doctor is the expert.  IBS doesn't show on scans and tends to stay in flare up mode if you have ongoing  .  You could try the Low Fodmap Diet or a food diary and try relaxation techniques.    Do you find your symptoms subside when you are busy?  This can be a sign of IBS.  Try light exercise such as walking or a hobby which can help to take your mind off your symptoms."

IBS is also not a disease its a symptom of something greater. If you had brittle bones, and went to the doctor and said, I have broken my bones multiple times this year. And she said. Sorry you have BBS brittle bone syndrome, try not to move as much and not walk to quickly. Maybe buy some padding. You would shake your head in disgust. I think you would try to find out why your bones were brittle and how to get them back to a strong state. Telling me I have IBS for no reason, that it won\u2019t get any better, that I just need to go home and limit what I eat and hope for the best is utterly ridiculous. Your bowel doesn\u2019t just become irritated, that is a symptom of a greater problem. Limiting food may help it heal. But why has it gotten so weak in the first place? I\u2019m 30 btw"

I was diagnosed with stress related IBS  and this was true because stress preceded my symptoms. While I am calm, I have no symptoms, but when I get anxious, my symptoms come back.  IBS is not necessarily a symptom of something greater.  I have nothing else worse going on with my gut.   Some people may have other things going on but this is not always the case.  IBS is not a cut and dry syndrome.  This why it is so difficult to diagnose and treat. I found that as soon as I trusted my doctor and accepted my diagnosis, my health anxiety and IBS got much better,  However, since your doctor has made mistakes, you should see someone else you can trust.  If you are given the same diagnosis by your new doctor, then you should accept it.  I had no faith in the first few doctors I saw  because they couldn't help me, but my last doctor identified my symptoms and that's why I trusted him.  Try seeing different doctors and this may give you the reassurance you need and the correct diagnosis and treatment."

I saw countless experts but until one simple remark led them to realize all the symptoms combined into one diagnosis. A physician sees you for one visit and often pressed for time due to government or private constraints. Seeing so many patients a day or even as you noted getting someone's information misfiled. I was asked my height  and said funny thing is I seem to have grown a couple of inches, and I was then in my fifties. This was after all kinds of tests. labs, X rays  scans, you name it. One week before my gallbladder burst I had a clean bill of health. A lot can change in a week. I got sepsis and even the ambulance guys thought I could safely get to the hospital on my own. I insisted they transport me so they could at least start an Iv. I am not saying my case is typical but if I had not insisted I would not be here today. If you do not think the staff is correctly treating you, get another opinion. A second opinion or how ever many it takes. A co worker just went through the bowel problems mentioned by another person here. Physicians can be mistaken like any other person. It is your body and your life. You know what is typical or normal for you, individually. No two people are exactly the same. It can cost more to get answers but can you put a price tag on your health?"

    "post": "In October 2018 I Started to feel a pain on my right side between my hip and my lower ribs.\nAbout this time i started to see what i thought was blood in my stool. It would seep out like a soaked rag, red all the way through.\nI went to the doctor they did blood tests, stool tests. The pain was slight and i had no other issues.\nBy January 2019 the pain had doubled, i now was not digesting food correctly, sometimes food would sit in my stomach for over half a day, leaving me bloated, burpy and really uncomfortable.\nAt the end of January i had an attack of sorts, had a large fatty meal. My body shut down, my right side was in so much pain. I also just felt poisoned, my urine was also this dark red colour over this time. The pain got so bad i had to go to hospital, where they said it was IBS and to go home.\nI Went back to the doctors, they did liver function tests, red/ white bloods, all the normal. stool test for blood and celiac disease, all came back \u201cnormal\u201d. I stressed that I thought this was gallstones or an issue with my pancreas and asked for an Ultrasound. It was a 3 week wait for my letter for the appointment for the ultrasound then a further 2 weeks for the ultrasound itself.\nA week after the ultrasound I had another attack, this one was worse. I had cured meats one night, and again body shut down. This time there was vomiting, shivering, and huge inflammation from my stomach through my full intestines. My urine again was dark red. I had diarrhoea for 3 full days, every 15 minutes. I couldn\u2019t eat, hardly slept. Due to the loss of electro lights my muscles started to ache and my toes started to curl and hurt. Started taking electro lights after this started to happen, stopped the muscle pain.\nThe diarrhoea was red, then it was just mucus, red/orange. Every time I drank water, more mucus would come out of me. I tried everything to stop from continually going to the toilet, out of desperation as I thought this was going to be my life from now till I died, I took a steroid anti inflammatory that my partner had left over from a treatment. Within 20 minutes the diarrhoea stopped. The pain went down. And I could eat again. But I had practically no stomach acid. Anything I ate sat in my stomach, caused huge amounts of pain. Passing through me mostly undigested. At this point I was on boiled rice and boiled chicken.\nI bought stomach enzymes, bile salts and stomach acid pills. Food was now being digested and now I had solid stools.\nI waited two weeks for my ultrasound which I got the results over the phone, they said it was fine no issues. Then 2 week wait to see my doctor to go over the results. She didn\u2019t have the scan, only the letter from the radiologist, which stated the size of my kidneys was normal. Which isn\u2019t really what I had the ultrasound for. No mention of my gallbladder or anything else. I was told I might need to wait for another ultrasound, at this point she had no record of the tests in January. So I had to have them all redone as well. That was Friday the 29th of March.\nI am still in a lot of pain, my right side is really sore. I am still seeing what looks like blood seeping out my stool. I have stopped taking the acid pills, but continue with the bile salts and the enzymes.\nI have no pain lower down only my right side and my stomach. I had tests for a urine infection when I had my first attack as well as checking my appendix. I\u2019ve also had tests for helicobacter pylori No signs of anything.\nThe doctor after her about the lack of stomach acid, prescribed me omeprazole and peppermint capsules. I asked, if I feel as if I\u2019m not digesting food, even to the point of supplementing my stomach acid, why prescribe something to reduce the stomach acid in my stomach. She said it would \u201ccreate a protective barrier\u201d which I\u2019m not quiet getting.\nShe has stated on every occasion that I have IBS and that\u2019s that. When I said the highly localised pain isn\u2019t a symptom of ibs usually. I was told that it can happen.\nLong term problems that might be import, maybe?\nin my late teens and early 20s I had random rush\u2019s of adrenaline my heart would race for no reason, beat out of my chest. Then stop. They tested my heart, refused to test my adrenals. It got less frequent over years. Then stopped.\nHigh carb meals since 13/14 years old till today have made me drop a sleep for 12 hours plus once for 48 hours. I started taking modafinil in my 20s to stay awake. This was on off till I gave up carbs.\nMid 20s I gave up carbs and went on a low carb diet for 5 years it changed my life I stopped falling a sleep and felt more present. Before this I gave up gluten. It helped but not as much as giving up a high carb diet. ive had to give this up since oct 2018.\nI have had ADD for most of my life, I have only recently been diagnosed as I now have the money to see a specialist. However the stimulants put me to sleep. No matter how many I take. I have been prescribed Adderall and Ritalin and Vyvanse, all of which have had no effect other than to put me to sleep. My doctor doesn\u2019t really understand why. Since my mid 20s I have started to lose my hair and have scalp acne, it is almost constantly sore. I\u2019ve tried every shampoo with no SLS or no additives. Baking soda. No shampoo. Etc. Everything you could think of. Nothing. Scalp feels soft, red, swollen.\nAny help with my failing body would be amazing.\nI feel as if my doctor wants me to just admit that this is it and not come back. But I\u2019m seeing her in two weeks. So any help you can give me would be really beneficial.\nThank you\nCooper",

It took a year of treatment before I became even fairly well. Be cautious of crank treatments and diets, desperate people are an easy market for con merchants. Keep going to the doctors and keep a diary of your symptoms. Try a different doctor or hospital. Regards, E"

Some days I throw up when I wake up, or if I'm not careful with how much I eat at once. Has anyone experienced this and/or has a solution? Is there any medication I should ask my doctor for?

Probiotics are basically healthy bacteria that support our gut, digestion and urinary tract. They are necessary for the correct functioning of our system and stronger immunity. Sadly various medications we take like   tend to kill both the good and bad bacteria, as a result gut flora is poor and various complications arise as a result. So my advise to you is to boost your diet on probiotics. Eat some yogurt, kefir or fermented milk. If your condition is too serious and you need immediate relief, use probiotic supplements. I would recommend Flourish Probiotics by Eu Natural.

    "post": "In October 2018 I Started to feel a pain on my right side between my hip and my lower ribs.\nAbout this time i started to see what i thought was blood in my stool. It would seep out like a soaked rag, red all the way through.\nI went to the doctor they did blood tests, stool tests. The pain was slight and i had no other issues.\nBy January 2019 the pain had doubled, i now was not digesting food correctly, sometimes food would sit in my stomach for over half a day, leaving me bloated, burpy and really uncomfortable.\nAt the end of January i had an attack of sorts, had a large fatty meal. My body shut down, my right side was in so much pain. I also just felt poisoned, my urine was also this dark red colour over this time.  The pain got so bad i had to go to hospital, where they said it was IBS and to go home.\nI Went back to the doctors, they did liver function tests, red/ white bloods, all the normal.  stool test for blood and celiac disease, all came back \u201cnormal\u201d. I stressed that I thought this was gallstones or an issue with my pancreas and asked for an Ultrasound. It was a 3 week wait for my letter for the appointment for the ultrasound then a further 2 weeks for the ultrasound itself.\nA week after the ultrasound I had another attack, this one was worse. I had cured meats one night, and again body shut down.  This time there was vomiting, shivering, and huge inflammation from my stomach through my full intestines. My urine again was dark red. I had diarrhoea for 3 full days, every 15 minutes. I couldn\u2019t eat, hardly slept. Due to the loss of electro lights my muscles started to ache and my toes started to curl and hurt. Started taking electro lights after this started to happen, stopped the muscle pain.\nThe diarrhoea was red, then it was just mucus, red/orange. Every time I drank water, more mucus would come out of me. I tried everything to stop from continually going to the toilet, out of desperation as I thought this was going to be my life from now till I died, I took a steroid anti inflammatory that my partner had left over from a treatment. Within 20 minutes the diarrhoea stopped. The pain went down. And I could eat again. But I had practically no stomach acid. Anything I ate sat in my stomach, caused huge amounts of pain. Passing through me mostly undigested. At this point I was on boiled rice and boiled chicken.\nI bought stomach enzymes, bile salts and stomach acid pills. Food was now being digested and now I had solid stools.\nI waited two weeks for my ultrasound which I got the results over the phone, they said it was fine no issues. Then 2 week wait to see my doctor to go over the results. She didn\u2019t have the scan, only the letter from the radiologist, which stated the size of my kidneys was normal. Which isn\u2019t really what I had the ultrasound for. No mention of my gallbladder or anything else. I was told I might need to wait for another ultrasound, at this point she had no record of the tests in January. So I had to have them all redone as well. That was Friday the 29th of March.\nI am still in a lot of pain, my right side is really sore. I am still seeing what looks like blood seeping out my stool. I have stopped taking the acid pills, but continue with the bile salts and the enzymes.\nI have no pain lower down only my right side and my stomach. I had tests for a urine infection when I had my first attack as well as checking my appendix. I\u2019ve also had tests for helicobacter pylori No signs of anything.\nThe doctor after her about the lack of stomach acid, prescribed me omeprazole and peppermint capsules. I asked, if I feel as if I\u2019m not digesting food, even to the point of supplementing my stomach acid, why prescribe something to reduce the stomach acid in my stomach. She said it would \u201ccreate a protective barrier\u201d which I\u2019m not quiet getting.\nShe has stated on every occasion that I have IBS and that\u2019s that. When I said the highly localised pain isn\u2019t a symptom of ibs usually. I was told that it can happen.\nLong term problems that might be import, maybe?\nin my late teens and early 20s I had random rush\u2019s of adrenaline my heart would race for no reason, beat out of my chest. Then stop. They tested my heart, refused to test my adrenals. It got less frequent over years. Then stopped.\nHigh carb meals since 13/14 years old till today have made me drop a sleep for 12 hours plus once for 48 hours. I started taking modafinil in my 20s to stay awake. This was on off till I gave up carbs.\nMid 20s I gave up carbs and went on a low carb diet for 5 years it changed my life I stopped falling a sleep and felt more present. Before this I gave up gluten. It helped but not as much as giving up a high carb diet. ive had to give this up since oct 2018.\nI have had ADD for most of my life, I have only recently been diagnosed as I now have the money to see a specialist. However the stimulants put me to sleep. No matter how many I take. I have been prescribed Adderall and Ritalin and Vyvanse, all of which have had no effect other than to put me to sleep. My doctor doesn\u2019t really understand why. Since my mid 20s I have started to lose my hair and have scalp acne, it is almost constantly sore. I\u2019ve tried every shampoo with no SLS or no additives. Baking soda. No shampoo. Etc. Everything you could think of. Nothing. Scalp feels soft, red, swollen.\nAny help with my failing body would be amazing.\nI feel as if my doctor wants me to just admit that this is it and not come back. But I\u2019m seeing her in two weeks. So any help you can give me would be really beneficial.\nThank you\nCooper",

I won't ever do them again because after 2 sit-ups, I felt gas bubbled up my neck, in some artery.  The first time around before I consumed any medication, both sides of my neck would hurt. I would feel the gas moving up my neck in a rush. It was a pulsated feeling. I also suffered pain in my forearms. At one point, my chest hurt. I realized these are heart attack signs. I couldn't believe it was happening and it was then I rushed to the hospital. Two weeks worth of 20mg Omeprazole got rid of all belching and aches. However, I was never specifically diagnosed. When I began exercising again, it returned. Therefore, I won't participate in abdominal nor strenous exercises."

    "post": "I believe it all started when I began exercising. I noticed that I was burping excessively. That went on for about a month so I visited my doctor. She diagnosed me with dyspepsia/ indigestion/ acid reflux. She prescribed Dica and Raniticidin. That didn't work. I went to another doctor, she prescribed Omeprazole. It worked like a charm. Unfortunately, the burping returned months later when I decided to do some situps. I felt gas bubbled up my neck instantly. The belching was worse and it came along with a burning sensation on the left lower part of my back. Sometimes I feel the middle of my back , on my spine , has mild pain. It burns whenever I sit upright but when I lie down, the burning subsides. I got Omeprazole again, and I hope it works. At the end of 2 weeks, I will give an update. If it doesn't work I'll have to see a gastroenterologist.\nHAS ANYONE FELT THIS WAY? WHAT  WORKED FOR YOU?",

One explained that a \"stalk\" of the gall bladder was left behind (the fault of a hurried surgeon, no doubt--I was lined up with other pre-surgical patients like we were on a conveyer belt $$$$$).\u00a0 That gall bladder stalk still fills with bile, as when the whole organ was there, hence the chronic pain, which I have learned has a name: Post-cholecystectomy Syndrome. I ordered a Biotherapy powder called Genuine Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) Thermal Spring Salt. You dissolve 1 tsp in warm water and drink 1-1/2 cup of before a meal, which is purported to help this problem.\u00a0 I tried it only once so far, and it seemed to help some.\u00a0 You have to be careful what you eat.\u00a0 I find I can no longer digest fats, nuts or nut butters, and there are special diets if you have no gall bladder that may help. As with the routine removal of children's tonsils in the '50s, I think some doctors are too quick to turn to surgery when other options might first be tried, but those don't usually make the big bucks.\u00a0 Even the littlest organs in our bodies, like tonsils and gall bladders, perform important functions.\u00a0 IMO, doctors who dismiss a desperate patient's search for answers to their problems on the Internet when doctors have none to offer should be stripped of their right to practice medicine or at least sent to a sensitivity training course.\u00a0"

I have Lupus,  ,   so I have bad days but this has turned into bad 3 months. Also I've been taking fluid meds for years, I swell normally in my fingers, legs feet and if it gets bad my stomach and all over but I told the I have swollen up bad especially in my upper abdomen. I also told her I've gained 45lbs in less than 3 months mostly in stomach which is very odd for me bc I'm usually a size 4 and can't gain weight even when I try. I just turned 40 but this isn't just middle aged spread especially since I've cut my calories to 1200 daily I eat hardly any sodium plenty of fiber. Anyway, BP is perfect,they tested mythyroid is goodand other blood work came back good they gave me a round of   and Prednisone bc if they don't know what it is it must be a Lupus flare but I've had Lupus 10 years this is not normal. I got the fluid down and everywhere and now I see it's not my usual fluid that my upper abdomen is swollen and it hurts if I press on it. My stomach muscles have been sore in a weird way not from exercising  deeper but feels like muscle aches. It swells worse at night every night. I don't have any stomach problems, no indigestion, gas or anything but I do feel uncomfortable after I eat like it swells more my head hurts and just feel funny and I don't overeat ex: 1 small wrap with her chicken Lett, tomato if I finish that. Im miserable, none of my tops fit my stomach just feels like a hard ball. I just moved from Alabama to TN so I'm having to find new Dr. I had same Dr for over 10 years he would have tested til he found out WTH is wrong. I've been to 2 Urgent Care Drs and now have a New Primary Care but she didn't do much and I still feel horrible. I have enough health issues that cause alot of pain to deal with new ones. Does anyone have any other symptoms like   headaches dizzy? I did try an ACAI Berry Cleanse for 5 days I got at Walmart it helped alot temp. The swelling went down for a couple days and some discomfort. It's all natural and actually good for you to do occasionally. If anyone has any advice or finds out any new news please let us know.

I've searched high and low for answers and haven't seen any. It appears the medical community is stumped by our problems. I wish they had some clinical trials that address our particular problem. I can't blame Doctors if their is no research or investment in this particular area of suffering by what appears to be many individuals. I'm righting not just because I've suffered for so long with no answers but because I appear to be the only male writing about this issue. I hope other males who face these symptoms will come forward also. Maybe if enough of us complain some medical clinic will take on our plight and look for real answers. Its obvious its not in our heads and we deserve the same attention as any other debilitating medical problems people are finding answers to.

            "reply_content": "Dear Bsaman001, I have similar problems but it NEVER means we have the same issue. I also feel very sorry for you and hope you hang in there. Do NOT give up. The first recommendation if your are going to try to help the G.I. Dr's find this issue is to watch how much comes out. If you are NOT going to the bathroom much and the amount going out is less than what is going in. The food is NOT going into stomach for whatever reasons or staying in stomach and is a Gastro issue. If you are just having bad stool and suffering. It sounds like a post gastro colon/prostate or maybe even Pancrease. The biggest problem you and the Doctors could be experiencing is a problem that is slowly about to show its ugly face when it completely fails. I got lucky on my diagnosis that they found the problem on the first endoscope. Because the second time they did endoscope. The problem was not present and I got rejected for 2 years and fought for my life. Then when it was obvious I was going to die, they admitted it was an intermittent issue and it had finally failed and they no longer debated my diagnosis. Never give up. Keep asking questions, keep begging, keep checking into E.R. too when it is at it's worse. Eventually it will be so present the right Doctor will make your day. Diagnosis is the first step towards recovery. As far as   attacks. They are my worse enemy. And the treatment is to blame it on psychology and ignore your issues. Do your best to hide and conceal it. Make them focus on the real issue causing it. It is NOT always a psychological issue. I wish I was  a Dr...There is another guy in this form Pippa. He seems to be the best help. Food Diary on what goes down and what comes up is a very good start. I did same thing and even charted my daily weight losses on a chart. It was useless after I found out what my disease was. But it did help me narrow it down. I still have certain foods and drinks I can eat and some I can NEVER touch again. How much weight have you lost so far? Do NOT let it get below 120lbs. or you will be in surgery danger zone. At 90 lbs and less no Dr. can help you. Onlya feeding tube will keep you alive. When you are ready go for it."

    "post": "Hello everyone, i am looking for some thoughts and advice about a health issue i have been battling for 8 months now.\nI am a 24yr old male and it all started back in july/august.\nOver 2 weeks i had 4 random episodes consisting of sudden overwhelming sickness usually followed by vomiting or gagging and sometimes a severe bowel movement or activity.\nThen one day in august shortly after getting up and eating normally it hit hard. had the same vomiting and severe nausia, but refused to stop all day and could not eat.\nThe next day followed the same, vomiting and gagging shortly after waking up with added severe diarrhea, no apatite, shaking, feverish, weakness, \n and \n. This occurred every day for 2 weeks. I was absolutely dead, would spend most days sat and wandering about my land necking bottles of water.\nEventually the diarrhea (replaced with sticky fowl smelling pale stools) and gagging/vomiting stopped. But the rest continued with general nausia and almost daily panic/anxiety attacks continued up and down in severity for 3 months causing me to loose about 2.5 stone over that time.\nDuring this time i saw 4 diffrent GPs once a week, was forced onto liquid meals for a while to counter the loss of apatite and weight loss the best i could. Went gluten and dairy free. Took over 10 stool samples which all came back clear except fecal calprotectin that came back 68 (told 0-50 was normal) 4 \n which were normal and ruled out celiac. Underwent a upper endoscopy and \n which came back clear including biopsies.\nThe symptoms toms slowly got less severe and 2 months ago managed to actually gain some weight back and had periods of feeling normal. But to this day i still suffer from abdominal pain and tenderness/soreness around my belly button especially after eating, tiredness, mild loss of apatite and nausia, bloating and gas and generalised anxiety and even over the smallest daily tasks especially eating.\nI feel that my doctors are out of ideas and classed it as ibs but with non of the following medicines greatly helping\nColestid, mebevaline, Amitriptyline 10mg, buscopan, probiotics, slippery elm extract, lansoprazole, imodium.\nI am a ruined man. It has destroyed my life and am on my knees begging for help.",

A waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1 in 5 gallstones is made of bilirubin) These chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile.  These can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble.  Sometimes only 1 stone will form, but there are often several at the same time."
