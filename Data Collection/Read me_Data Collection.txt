In this problem , I used Xpath to parse webpages. And for each post, it has two main part information, the first part is its author name, post time, and post content. The second part is its reply. For each reply, it also includes author name, reply time and reply content. The final result is stored as json format. The result is stored in Patient.json file

The code is in crawler.py
