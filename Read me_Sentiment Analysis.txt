For this sentiment analysis problem , I have tried three different algorithms to get a better result.  
The whole process includes data preprocessing, feature selection and modeling.
For the data preprocessing part, I have remove punctuation and stop words and special tag such as </br>
For the feature selection part, I have tried TF_IDF and wordvector
For the modeling , I have tried machine learning algorithm and deep learning .

The following are three different algorithms and their result

1. Tf-IDF + XGboost accuracy is 0.88
2. Tf-IDF + MLP  accuracy is 0.83
3. Wordvector+ LSTM accuracy is 0.85

In conclusion, TF+XGboost has the best performance. Actually I expected LSTM has the best performance, but due to time limitation , I have little time to do parameter tuning. I will improve it in the future.
